APN Charter2022-10-25Current networks carry traffic with widely varying characteristics, including but not limited to, online gaming, video streaming, and enterprise video conferencing, some having more demanding performance requirements than traditional best-effort traffic. These include requirements related to low network latency and high bandwidth. Appropriate handling of such traffic may need to use mechanisms such as deterministic networking and networking slicing and in, general, more functionality than simple QoS, such as the IP DSCP, can provide.Appropriate Performance Networking (APN) aims to address these requirements and further facilitate use of such technologies. The goal is to provide network operators with the ability to perform fine-granularity network service provisioning and group-level SLA (Service Level Agreement) assurances to achieve better Quality of Experience (QoE) for end users, as opposed to course-grained traffic operations.The APN Working Group will develop a framework supporting fine-granularity network service provisioning (traffic operations) within the network domain(s) that supports APN (i.e., APN domains). By APN domain we refer to the infrastructure domain where APN is used from edge to edge (ingress to egress) and within which the packet is encapsulated using an outer header incorporating APN information. As part of the framework development, the working group will analyze and define the requirements for such fine-grained provisioning.An APN domain is defined as a limited domain controlled by a Network Operator (or set of cooperating Network Operators), in which MPLS, VXLAN, SR/SRv6, or other already standardized tunnel technologies are adopted to provide network services. APN packets within such a domain carry additional APN Information in packet headers using extension mechanisms of existing standardized protocols. The APN Information carried in packets is only applicable within the APN domain and will facilitate fine-granularity service provisioning within the domain.  APN Information for a packet is derived from existing information in that packet’s headers at the APN domain ingress and the port on which the packet is received, according to rules and policies configured on the edge devices; this information is added to the packets, used within the APN domain, and removed from the packets leaving the domain. The working group will analyze the security and privacy impact of APN Information and minimize the privacy impact consistent with APN goals,APN aims to use the ability to apply policies based on APN Information to traffic flows entering into the infrastructure (APN domain). For example, at the headend (ingress) traffic may be steered to a given path/policy/slice, at a midpoint node the corresponding performance measurement data may be collected, and at a service node, a given function may be executed.The APN working group deliverables are limited to a Problem Statement and Use Cases document and an APN Framework documen.MilestonesDate         Deliverable and MilestoneMar 2023    Working Group Adoption of Problem Statement and Use Cases draftApr 2023    Working Group Adoption of APN Framework draftNov 2023    Problem Statement and Use Cases document submitted to IESGNov 2023    Framework document submitted to IESG
